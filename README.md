- **Network Integration**: Fetches content from a remote server and displays it in a clean, organized feed.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages and feedback for users in case of network or other issues.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Kotlin – A modern, statically typed programming language for Android development.
- **Framework**: **Jetpack Compose** – A modern Android UI toolkit for building UIs declaratively.
- **Design**: **Material Design** – A unified design system to create beautiful, accessible UIs.
- **Architecture**: **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** – A clean architecture pattern for separating UI logic from business logic and ensuring maintainability.
- **Networking**: **Retrofit** – A type-safe HTTP client for Android to fetch content from the backend API.
- **Testing**: Unit and UI tests with **JUnit** and **Compose Testing** for ensuring app stability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio**: Make sure you have the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) installed.
- **Android SDK**: Required for building the project.

### Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-social-feed-app.git
```

### Setup
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Select "Open an Existing Project" and navigate to the project directory.
3. Sync the project with Gradle files.
4. Build and run the project.

## Running the Application

1. Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
2. Run the app from Android Studio using the **Run** button.
3. The app will launch, displaying a feed with posts. You can like, comment, and interact with the content.

## Features Walkthrough

1. **Social Feed Display**:
    - The feed consists of posts that contain a mix of text, images, and user interactions.
    - Users can scroll through posts, view content, and interact with them.

2. **Like, Comment, and Share**:
    - Posts have options for users to like, comment, and share.
    - Each interaction updates the UI immediately, reflecting the current state of the post.

3. **Network Data Fetching**:
    - Content is fetched from a remote server using **Retrofit**.
    - The app handles network calls efficiently and shows loading indicators while fetching data.

4. **Responsive Layout**:
    - The app is responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes such as phones and tablets.
    - The UI adjusts dynamically to provide an optimal user experience.

5. **Error Handling**:
    - Proper error handling ensures users get feedback in case of network issues or other failures.

## Architecture

- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**: The app is built using the **MVVM** architecture, separating the UI from the business logic to ensure modularity and maintainability.
    - **Model**: Manages the data layer, including network calls and data storage.
    - **View**: The UI layer, built with **Jetpack Compose**.
    - **ViewModel**: Holds and manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, providing a clear separation between UI and business logic.

- **Clean Architecture**: The project follows clean architecture principles, ensuring that the code is modular, testable, and easy to maintain.
